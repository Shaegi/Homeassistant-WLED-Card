  - https://iro.js.org/introduction.html

3. Clone repo and put it under www/wled_control/

4. Add this to ressources in config/lovelace.ui.yaml
````
  - url: /local/wled_control/dist/main.js
    type: module

5. Add the custom card like this

> Note: IP is needed to load the initial state of WLED since we don't save the state in hassio all communication with the led will happen by MQTT-Messages

````
- type: custom:wled-control-card
        topic: "wled/[MQTTCHANNEL]"
        ip: "[WLEDIP]"
